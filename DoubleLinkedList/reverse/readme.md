# Reverse method

This method reverses the order of the nodes in the list
i.e. the first node becomes the last node, the second node becomes the second-to-last node, and so on.

## Key

Change the direction of the pointers between nodes so that they point in the opposite direction

### instruction

1. set head to current node
2. swap the prev and next pointers of node points to until temp is none
3. swap head and tail
